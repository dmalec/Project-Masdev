Project Masdev
==============
Project Masdev captures a series of steps in creating an arduino monitored
and controlled vivarium as well as the cumulative sketch that results from
the individual additions of functionality.  Hopefully, others can use it
in their own projects.

Why Project Masdev
------------------
This project got its start when I aquired a Masdevallia orchid, requiring
a greater attention to humidity and temperature than my other orchids.
